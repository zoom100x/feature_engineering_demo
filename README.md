# 🧠 Feature Engineering Playground

An interactive Streamlit demo app for exploring and applying common feature engineering techniques on tabular datasets. Ideal for data scientists, students, and educators looking to understand the impact of preprocessing on data and model performance.

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Upload your own CSV dataset or use a default Titanic dataset.
- 🧹 Select one preprocessing technique at a time:
  - Fill missing values
  - Encode categorical variables
  - Scale numerical features
- 📊 View the dataset before and after transformation.
- ⚙️ Easily expandable for additional feature engineering steps or machine learning integration.
